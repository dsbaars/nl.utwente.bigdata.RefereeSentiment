<h1>Referee Sentiment during World Cup based on Tweets</h1>
<h4>Managing Big Data Course at University of Twente, The Netherlands (201200044)</h4>
<btf-markdown>Over the years Twitter has become a very large and rich
source of data with over 500 million tweets per day. During
the FIFA World Cup 2014 an enormous amount of tweets
were produced. These can be analyzed to get interesting
insights in such a large sport event. In this paper we report
about how tweets are utilized to determine the public
opinion of the referees during the matches in real-time. This
results in a visual representation of the public opinion during
matches. This can be used by FIFA in more carefully
selecting their referees. The presented methodology can also
be applied to other types of sport events.</btf-markdown>

This prototype merely serves as an instrument to show the
possibilities, therefore it is limited in its functionality. In
increasing the maturity the following actions could be taken:

-   Improve the sentiment calculation by detecting sarcasm
and extending the word lists with trained data
-   Increase the number of languages used for sentiment
detection by adding more word lists
-   Improving the sentiment analysis by the techniques described
by Guerra et al. and Barbosa &amp; Feng.
-   Introduce an extra dimension to the visual representation:
make a distinction between the country of the
team and native language of the user from the tweet.
People from the home country of the team are likely
to have a bias.
